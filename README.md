This repository contains my daily solutions to the [Tailwind Battle](https://www.tailwindbattle.com/) challenges.

**About Tailwind Battle:**  
[Tailwind Battle](https://www.tailwindbattle.com/) is a platform where you can practice your CSS skills by recreating provided designs using Tailwind CSS. You get scored based on how closely you match the target, and you can track your progress and improvement over time.

**Note:**  
- All accuracy values are provided by the Tailwind Battle website, reflecting how closely my solution matches their target design.  
- `My Accuracy` is my personal accuracy for each challenge.  
- `My Chars` is the total number of characters in my solution.  
- `AVG Accuracy (Others)` and `AVG Chars (Others)` reflect the average accuracy and character counts achieved by other users who completed the challenge **at the time it was written**. These values may shift as more submissions are made.  
- Character counts can be further reduced by skipping proper HTML formatting (e.g., removing spaces and line breaks), though this is not strictly necessary.
