# Tailwind Battle Solutions

This repository contains my daily solutions to the [Tailwind Battle](https://www.tailwindbattle.com/) challenges.

**About Tailwind Battle:**  
[Tailwind Battle](https://www.tailwindbattle.com/) is a platform where you can practice your CSS skills by recreating provided designs using Tailwind CSS. You get scored based on how closely you match the target, and you can track your progress and improvement over time.

**Note:**  
- All accuracy values are provided by the Tailwind Battle website, reflecting how closely my solution matches their target design.  
- `My Chars` is the total number of characters in my solution.  
- `AVG Chars (Others)` represents the average total characters used by other users who completed the same challenge **at the time it was written**. Over time, as new submissions are made, these averages may shift.
